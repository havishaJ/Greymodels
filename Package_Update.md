# Breakdown of Changes made to Greymodels package

| Submission | Reviewer's comments | Changes made to Greymodels' package |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| First submission #4710 | Lack of modularity means it is hard/impossible for others to reuse/modify/incorporate into their work. Does not follow well-established packaging guidelines for R projects. Does not appear to have any tests (automated or manual procedures). | Modularized the Greymodels Shiny app. Package updated as per R project guidelines. The Greymodels package includes a Help tab that gives the use of the package and the different models implemented and an About Grey tab that explain the different categories of the grey models. An animated guide is also available to demonstrate the use of data. |
| Second submission #4761|  I'm going to reject this submission at this point, as it doesn't use git/GitHub in the normal way, as a version control repository for the project but rather is using it as an archival repository. Please review some of the repositories of other software published by JOSS, and take a look at R packaging guidelines (for example, https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/writing-r-package/). Feel free to resubmit submit after using more standard practices. Also, your paper is over twice as long as is recommended for JOSS papers, so more work is needed to reduce it. | Package updated and has has been publised on CRAN and GitHub, following the R packaging guidelines |
