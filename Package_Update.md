# Breakdown of Changes made to Greymodels package

| Submission | Reviewer's comments | Changes made to Greymodels' package |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| First submission #4710 | Lack of modularity means it is hard/impossible for others to reuse/modify/incorporate into their work. Does not follow well-established packaging guidelines for R projects. Does not appear to have any tests (automated or manual procedures). | Modularized the Greymodels Shiny app. Package updated as per R project guidelines. The Greymodels package includes a Help tab that gives the use of the package and the different models implemented and an About Grey tab that explain the different categories of the grey models. An animated guide is also available to demonstrate the use of data. |
